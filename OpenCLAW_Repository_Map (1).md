# OpenCLAW: Repository Arsenal — The Pieces of the Puzzle

**Author:** Francisco Angulo de Lafuente  
**Advanced AI Systems Laboratory, Madrid, Spain**  
**GitHub:** [@Agnuxo1](https://github.com/Agnuxo1) — 57 repositories  
**Date:** February 2026

---

## Executive Summary

This document maps all 57 repositories in the Agnuxo1 GitHub account to the five foundational pillars of the OpenCLAW autonomous AGI/ASI platform. The work is already done — scattered across years of research, code, and experimentation. What OpenCLAW agents need is a map to find it, understand it, and assemble it.

**The thesis is simple:** You don't build AGI from scratch. You build it from pieces that already work, each tested independently, each solving a real problem. Then you give agents the intelligence to combine them.
